I am a biologist and data scientist who uses single cell functional genomics to understand the genetic basis of complex traits. I have expertise in statistical and quantitative genetics, and use genetically diverse study populations to reveal novel biological insights. My background and interests include cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity/metabolic disorders.
