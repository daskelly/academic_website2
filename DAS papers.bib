	abstract = {Gene expression is known to be affected by interactions between local genetic variation and DNA accessibility, with the latter organized into three-dimensional chromatin structures. Analyses of these interactions have previously been limited, obscuring their regulatory context, and the extent to which they occur throughout the genome. Here, we undertake a genome-scale analysis of these interactions in a genetically diverse population to systematically identify global genetic-epigenetic interaction, and reveal constraints imposed by chromatin structure. We establish the extent and structure of genotype-by-epigenotype interaction using embryonic stem cells derived from Diversity Outbred mice. This mouse population segregates millions of variants from eight inbred founders, enabling precision genetic mapping with extensive genotypic and phenotypic diversity. With 176 samples profiled for genotype, gene expression, and open chromatin, we used regression modeling to infer genetic-epigenetic interactions on a genome-wide scale. Our results demonstrate that statistical interactions between genetic variants and chromatin accessibility are common throughout the genome. We found that these interactions occur within the local area of the affected gene, and that this locality corresponds to topologically associated domains (TADs). The likelihood of interaction was most strongly defined by the three-dimensional (3D) domain structure rather than linear DNA sequence. We show that stable 3D genome structure is an effective tool to guide searches for regulatory elements and, conversely, that regulatory elements in genetically diverse populations provide a means to infer 3D genome structure. We confirmed this finding with CTCF ChIP-seq that revealed strain-specific binding in the inbred founder mice. In stem cells, open chromatin participating in the most significant regression models demonstrated an enrichment for developmental genes and the TAD-forming CTCF-binding complex, providing an opportunity for statistical inference of shifting TAD boundaries operating during early development. These findings provide evidence that genetic and epigenetic factors operate within the context of 3D chromatin structure.},

	doi = {10.1101/2024.04.16.589625},
	abstract = {Background:
Age is the principal risk factor for neurodegeneration in both the retina and brain. The retina and brain share many biological properties; thus, insights into retinal aging and degeneration may shed light onto similar processes in the brain. Genetic makeup strongly influences susceptibility to age-related retinal disease. However, studies investigating retinal aging have not sufficiently accounted for genetic diversity. Therefore, examining molecular aging in the retina across different genetic backgrounds will enhance our understanding of human-relevant aging and degeneration in both the retina and brain—potentially improving therapeutic approaches to these debilitating conditions.

Methods:
Transcriptomics and proteomics were employed to elucidate retinal aging signatures in nine genetically diverse mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvlmJ, NZO/HlLtJ, WSB/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhK, NOD/ShiLtJ, A/J, and BALB/cJ) across lifespan. These data predicted human disease-relevant changes in WSB and NZO strains. Accordingly, B6, WSB and NZO mice were subjected to human-relevant in vivo examinations at 4, 8, 12, and/or 18M, including: slit lamp, fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and pattern/full-field electroretinography. Retinal morphology, vascular structure, and cell counts were assessed ex vivo.

Results:
We identified common molecular aging signatures across the nine mouse strains, which included genes associated with photoreceptor function and immune activation. Genetic background strongly modulated these aging signatures. Analysis of cell type-specific marker genes predicted age-related loss of photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in WSB and NZO, respectively. Fundus exams revealed retinitis pigmentosa-relevant pigmentary abnormalities in WSB retinas and diabetic retinopathy (DR)-relevant cotton wool spots and exudates in NZO retinas. Profound photoreceptor dysfunction and loss were confirmed in WSB. Molecular analyses indicated changes in photoreceptor-specific proteins prior to loss, suggesting photoreceptor-intrinsic dysfunction in WSB. In addition, age-associated RGC dysfunction, loss, and concomitant microvascular dysfunction was observed in NZO mice. Proteomic analyses revealed an early reduction in protective antioxidant processes, which may underlie increased susceptibility to DR-relevant pathology in NZO.

Conclusions:
Genetic context is a strong determinant of retinal aging, and our multi-omics resource can aid in understanding age-related diseases of the eye and brain. Our investigations identified and validated WSB and NZO mice as improved preclinical models relevant to common retinal neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Identifying host genetic factors modulating immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy has been experimentally challenging because of variations in both host and tumor genomes, differences in the microbiome, and patient life exposures. Utilizing the Collaborative Cross (CC) multi-parent mouse genetic resource population, we developed an approach that fixes the tumor genomic configuration while varying host genetics. With this approach, we discovered that response to anti-PD-1 (aPD1) immunotherapy was significantly heritable in four distinct murine tumor models (H2 between 0.18-0.40). For the MC38 colorectal carcinoma system (H2 = 0.40), we mapped four significant ICI response quantitative trait loci (QTL) localized to mouse chromosomes (mChr) 5, 9, 15 and 17, and identified significant epistatic interactions between specific QTL pairs. Differentially expressed genes within these QTL were highly enriched for immune genes and pathways mediating allograft rejection and graft vs host disease. Using a cross species analytical approach, we found a core network of 48 genes within the four QTLs that showed significant prognostic value for overall survival in aPD1 treated human cohorts that outperformed all other existing validated immunotherapy biomarkers, especially in human tumors of the previously defined immune subtype 4. Functional blockade of two top candidate immune targets within the 48 gene network, GM-CSF and high affinity IL-2/IL-15 signaling, completely abrogated the MC38 tumor transcriptional response to aPD1 therapy in vivo. Thus, we have established a powerful cross species in vivo platform capable of uncovering host genetic factors that establish the tumor immune microenvironment configuration propitious for ICI response.},

Little is known about the basis of the variable genomic integrity among different PSC lines. Here we identify aneuploidies using RNA-seq and proteomics data from a panel of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines derived from 170 Diversity Outbred mice. We identified 62 lines with detectable aneuploid subpopulations and a subset of originally XX lines that lost one Chromosome X (XO). Strikingly, a much lower proportion of XX lines were aneuploid, compared to XY or XO lines. Two single-cell RNA-seq data sets demonstrated that aneuploid XY DO mESC also show lower Chromosome X gene expression and that XY mESC accumulate higher aneuploid proportions in culture than isogenic XX lines. Possible mechanisms for this protective effect of X chromosome dosage include our discovery that the lines with two active X Chromosomes have a higher expression of 2-cell-like state genes, and differential expression of X-linked tumor suppressor genes associated with DNA damage response.

	abstract = {Enhancers play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and their functional status can be queried with cell type precision using using single-cell (sc)ATAC-seq. To facilitate analysis of such data, we developed Enhlink, a novel computational approach that leverages single-cell signals to infer linkages between regulatory DNA sequences, such as enhancers and promoters. Enhlink uses an ensemble strategy that integrates cell-level technical covariates to control for batch effects and biological covariates to infer robust condition-specific links and their associated p-values. It can integrate simultaneous gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements of individual cells profiled by multi-omic experiments for increased specificity. We evaluated Enhlink using simulated and real scATAC-seq data, including those paired with physical enhancer-promoter links enumerated by promoter capture Hi-C and with multi-omic scATAC-/RNA-seq data we generated from the mouse striatum. These examples demonstrated that our method outperforms popular alternative strategies. In conjunction with eQTL analysis, Enhlink revealed a putative super-enhancer regulating key cell type-specific markers of striatal neurons. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate that Enhlink is accurate, powerful, and provides features that can lead to novel biological insights.},

	abstract = {Genetic background drives phenotypic variability in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Most studies to date have used transcript abundance as the primary molecular readout of cell state in PSCs. We performed a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis of 190 genetically diverse mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines. The quantitative proteome is highly variable across lines, and we identified pluripotency-associated pathways that were differentially activated in the proteomics data that were not evident in transcriptome data from the same lines. Integration of protein abundance to transcript levels and chromatin accessibility revealed broad co-variation across molecular layers as well as shared and unique drivers of quantitative variation in pluripotency-associated pathways. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping localized the drivers of these multi-omic signatures to genomic hotspots. This study reveals post-transcriptional mechanisms and genetic interactions that underlie quantitative variability in the pluripotent proteome and provides a regulatory map for mESCs that can provide a basis for future mechanistic studies.},
